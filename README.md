Overview:
The Cologne Protocol is a geostatistical approach for estimating prehistoric population size and density. This repository contains a manual on how to model Core Areas with MapInfo 8.5 and Vertical Mapper 3.5 and the choose of the optimal describing Isoline in MS-Excel.

How to use
It is recommended to read the publication and supplement (Schmidt et al. 2020) first and then to start with the example application described in the Manual_S01_ODI_MapInfo.pdf.

Other resources
There are other manuals and recourses to fulfill the first two parts of the Cologne Protocol (manuals for R, QGIS, MapInfo and ArcGIS). Please see the above mentionesd publication for more information.
